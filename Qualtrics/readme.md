# Qualtrics Survey

We ran two parallel surveys (one for a Liberal sample and one for a Conservative sample). The Surveys are duplicates of eachother (only separated for ease of data processing). We have included a Qualtrics QSF file so that the survey can be imported into Qualtrics. Additionally, a Word document was exported, although this version has visual formatting errors intrinsic to the export process.
